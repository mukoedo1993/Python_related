A namespaces is a mapping from names to objects.

The important thing to know about namespaces is that there
is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces;
for instance, two namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation
between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules
may both define a function maximize without confusion -- users of the modules
must prefix it with the module name.
