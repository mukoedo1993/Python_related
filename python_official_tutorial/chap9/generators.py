Generators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators.
They are written like regular functions but use the yield statement
whenever they want to return data. Each time next() is called on it, 
the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data values
and which statement was last executed). An example shows that generators can
be trivially easy to create:
"""

def reverse(data):
    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
        yield data[index]

for char in reverse('golf'):
    print(char)
