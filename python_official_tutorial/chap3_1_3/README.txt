 In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. 
 The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false.
 
 
 The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python's way of grouping statements. As the interactive prompt, you have to type
 a tab or space(s) for each indented line.
