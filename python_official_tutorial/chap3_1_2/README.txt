extra notes: 
String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. 
End of lines are automatically included in the string, 


immutable
An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.
