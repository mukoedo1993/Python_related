If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the
definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you
want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to
prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead.
This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split
it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function
that you've written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.

MODULE:
To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them
in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called
a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main
module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top
level and in calculator mode).
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module
name with the suffix.py appended. Within a module, the module's name (as a string) is available
as the value of the global variable __name__ .For instance, use your favorite text editor to create
a file called fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents:
