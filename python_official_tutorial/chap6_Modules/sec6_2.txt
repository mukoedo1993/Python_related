"""
Python comes with a library of std. modules, described in a separate
document, the Python Library Reference ("Library Reference" hereafter).
Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to 
operations that are not part of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for
efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.
